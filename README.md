## Development (Windows)

Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell) in the project folder and run:

```bash
cd "c:\\MARTIN_Portfolio\\portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server (default: `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Build output will be placed in the `dist/` folder, ready for deployment.

## Deployment

Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Surge). Vercel and Netlify integrate directly with GitHub for automatic deployments from `main`.

If you want, I can also:

- add a polished project `projects` data file (`src/data/projects.js`),
- optimize images and enable lazy-loading, or
- create a `.gitignore` tailored for React/Vite projects and a recommended commit message template.

Replace or customize any section — tell me what you prefer.
